"4","You don’t know about me without you have read a book by the name of The"
"5","Adventures of Tom Sawyer; but that ain’t no matter. That book was made"
"6","by Mr. Mark Twain, and he told the truth, mainly. There was things"
"7","which he stretched, but mainly he told the truth. That is nothing. I"
"8","never seen anybody but lied one time or another, without it was Aunt"
"9","Polly, or the widow, or maybe Mary. Aunt Polly—Tom’s Aunt Polly, she"
"10","is—and Mary, and the Widow Douglas is all told about in that book,"
"11","which is mostly a true book, with some stretchers, as I said before."
"12",""
"13","Now the way that the book winds up is this: Tom and me found the money"
"14","that the robbers hid in the cave, and it made us rich. We got six"
"15","thousand dollars apiece—all gold. It was an awful sight of money when"
"16","it was piled up. Well, Judge Thatcher he took it and put it out at"
"17","interest, and it fetched us a dollar a day apiece all the year"
"18","round—more than a body could tell what to do with. The Widow Douglas"
"19","she took me for her son, and allowed she would sivilize me; but it was"
"20","rough living in the house all the time, considering how dismal regular"
"21","and decent the widow was in all her ways; and so when I couldn’t stand"
"22","it no longer I lit out. I got into my old rags and my sugar-hogshead"
"23","again, and was free and satisfied. But Tom Sawyer he hunted me up and"
"24","said he was going to start a band of robbers, and I might join if I"
"25","would go back to the widow and be respectable. So I went back."
"26",""
"27","The widow she cried over me, and called me a poor lost lamb, and she"
"28","called me a lot of other names, too, but she never meant no harm by it."
"29","She put me in them new clothes again, and I couldn’t do nothing but"
"30","sweat and sweat, and feel all cramped up. Well, then, the old thing"
"31","commenced again. The widow rung a bell for supper, and you had to come"
"32","to time. When you got to the table you couldn’t go right to eating, but"
"33","you had to wait for the widow to tuck down her head and grumble a"
"34","little over the victuals, though there warn’t really anything the"
"35","matter with them,—that is, nothing only everything was cooked by"
"36","itself. In a barrel of odds and ends it is different; things get mixed"
"37","up, and the juice kind of swaps around, and the things go better."
"38",""
"39","After supper she got out her book and learned me about Moses and the"
"40","Bulrushers, and I was in a sweat to find out all about him; but"
"41","by-and-by she let it out that Moses had been dead a considerable long"
"42","time; so then I didn’t care no more about him, because I don’t take no"
"43","stock in dead people."
"44",""
"45","Pretty soon I wanted to smoke, and asked the widow to let me. But she"
"46","wouldn’t. She said it was a mean practice and wasn’t clean, and I must"
"47","try to not do it any more. That is just the way with some people. They"
"48","get down on a thing when they don’t know nothing about it. Here she was"
"49","a-bothering about Moses, which was no kin to her, and no use to"
"50","anybody, being gone, you see, yet finding a power of fault with me for"
"51","doing a thing that had some good in it. And she took snuff, too; of"
"52","course that was all right, because she done it herself."
"53",""
"54","Her sister, Miss Watson, a tolerable slim old maid, with goggles on,"
"55","had just come to live with her, and took a set at me now with a"
"56","spelling-book. She worked me middling hard for about an hour, and then"
"57","the widow made her ease up. I couldn’t stood it much longer. Then for"
"58","an hour it was deadly dull, and I was fidgety. Miss Watson would say,"
"59","“Don’t put your feet up there, Huckleberry;” and “Don’t scrunch up like"
"60","that, Huckleberry—set up straight;” and pretty soon she would say,"
"61","“Don’t gap and stretch like that, Huckleberry—why don’t you try to"
"62","behave?” Then she told me all about the bad place, and I said I wished"
"63","I was there. She got mad then, but I didn’t mean no harm. All I wanted"
"64","was to go somewheres; all I wanted was a change, I warn’t particular."
"65","She said it was wicked to say what I said; said she wouldn’t say it for"
"66","the whole world; she was going to live so as to go to the good place."
"67","Well, I couldn’t see no advantage in going where she was going, so I"
"68","made up my mind I wouldn’t try for it. But I never said so, because it"
"69","would only make trouble, and wouldn’t do no good."
"70",""
"71","Now she had got a start, and she went on and told me all about the good"
"72","place. She said all a body would have to do there was to go around all"
"73","day long with a harp and sing, forever and ever. So I didn’t think much"
"74","of it. But I never said so. I asked her if she reckoned Tom Sawyer"
"75","would go there, and she said not by a considerable sight. I was glad"
"76","about that, because I wanted him and me to be together."
"77",""
"78","Miss Watson she kept pecking at me, and it got tiresome and lonesome."
"79","By-and-by they fetched the niggers in and had prayers, and then"
"80","everybody was off to bed. I went up to my room with a piece of candle,"
"81","and put it on the table. Then I set down in a chair by the window and"
"82","tried to think of something cheerful, but it warn’t no use. I felt so"
"83","lonesome I most wished I was dead. The stars were shining, and the"
"84","leaves rustled in the woods ever so mournful; and I heard an owl, away"
"85","off, who-whooing about somebody that was dead, and a whippowill and a"
"86","dog crying about somebody that was going to die; and the wind was"
"87","trying to whisper something to me, and I couldn’t make out what it was,"
"88","and so it made the cold shivers run over me. Then away out in the woods"
"89","I heard that kind of a sound that a ghost makes when it wants to tell"
"90","about something that’s on its mind and can’t make itself understood,"
"91","and so can’t rest easy in its grave, and has to go about that way every"
"92","night grieving. I got so down-hearted and scared I did wish I had some"
"93","company. Pretty soon a spider went crawling up my shoulder, and I"
"94","flipped it off and it lit in the candle; and before I could budge it"
"95","was all shriveled up. I didn’t need anybody to tell me that that was an"
"96","awful bad sign and would fetch me some bad luck, so I was scared and"
"97","most shook the clothes off of me. I got up and turned around in my"
"98","tracks three times and crossed my breast every time; and then I tied up"
"99","a little lock of my hair with a thread to keep witches away. But I"
"100","hadn’t no confidence. You do that when you’ve lost a horseshoe that"
"101","you’ve found, instead of nailing it up over the door, but I hadn’t ever"
"102","heard anybody say it was any way to keep off bad luck when you’d killed"
"103","a spider."
"104",""
"105","I set down again, a-shaking all over, and got out my pipe for a smoke;"
"106","for the house was all as still as death now, and so the widow wouldn’t"
"107","know. Well, after a long time I heard the clock away off in the town go"
"108","boom—boom—boom—twelve licks; and all still again—stiller than ever."
"109","Pretty soon I heard a twig snap down in the dark amongst the"
"110","trees—something was a stirring. I set still and listened. Directly I"
"111","could just barely hear a “_me-yow! me-yow!_” down there. That was good!"
"112","Says I, “_me-yow! me-yow!_” as soft as I could, and then I put out the"
"113","light and scrambled out of the window on to the shed. Then I slipped"
"114","down to the ground and crawled in among the trees, and, sure enough,"
"115","there was Tom Sawyer waiting for me."

"120","CHAPTER II."
"121",""
"122",""
"123","We went tiptoeing along a path amongst the trees back towards the end"
"124","of the widow’s garden, stooping down so as the branches wouldn’t scrape"
"125","our heads. When we was passing by the kitchen I fell over a root and"
"126","made a noise. We scrouched down and laid still. Miss Watson’s big"
"127","nigger, named Jim, was setting in the kitchen door; we could see him"
"128","pretty clear, because there was a light behind him. He got up and"
"129","stretched his neck out about a minute, listening. Then he says:"
"130",""
"131","“Who dah?”"
"132",""
"133","He listened some more; then he come tiptoeing down and stood right"
"134","between us; we could a touched him, nearly. Well, likely it was minutes"
"135","and minutes that there warn’t a sound, and we all there so close"
"136","together. There was a place on my ankle that got to itching, but I"
"137","dasn’t scratch it; and then my ear begun to itch; and next my back,"
"138","right between my shoulders. Seemed like I’d die if I couldn’t scratch."
"139","Well, I’ve noticed that thing plenty times since. If you are with the"
"140","quality, or at a funeral, or trying to go to sleep when you ain’t"
"141","sleepy—if you are anywheres where it won’t do for you to scratch, why"
"142","you will itch all over in upwards of a thousand places. Pretty soon Jim"
"143","says:"
"144",""
"145","“Say, who is you? Whar is you? Dog my cats ef I didn’ hear sumf’n."
"146","Well, I know what I’s gwyne to do: I’s gwyne to set down here and"
"147","listen tell I hears it agin.”"
"148",""
"149","So he set down on the ground betwixt me and Tom. He leaned his back up"
"150","against a tree, and stretched his legs out till one of them most"
"151","touched one of mine. My nose begun to itch. It itched till the tears"
"152","come into my eyes. But I dasn’t scratch. Then it begun to itch on the"
"153","inside. Next I got to itching underneath. I didn’t know how I was going"
"154","to set still. This miserableness went on as much as six or seven"
"155","minutes; but it seemed a sight longer than that. I was itching in"
"156","eleven different places now. I reckoned I couldn’t stand it more’n a"
"157","minute longer, but I set my teeth hard and got ready to try. Just then"
"158","Jim begun to breathe heavy; next he begun to snore—and then I was"
"159","pretty soon comfortable again."
"160",""
"161","Tom he made a sign to me—kind of a little noise with his mouth—and we"
"162","went creeping away on our hands and knees. When we was ten foot off Tom"
"163","whispered to me, and wanted to tie Jim to the tree for fun. But I said"
"164","no; he might wake and make a disturbance, and then they’d find out I"
"165","warn’t in. Then Tom said he hadn’t got candles enough, and he would"
"166","slip in the kitchen and get some more. I didn’t want him to try. I said"
"167","Jim might wake up and come. But Tom wanted to resk it; so we slid in"
"168","there and got three candles, and Tom laid five cents on the table for"
"169","pay. Then we got out, and I was in a sweat to get away; but nothing"
"170","would do Tom but he must crawl to where Jim was, on his hands and"
"171","knees, and play something on him. I waited, and it seemed a good while,"
"172","everything was so still and lonesome."
"173",""
"174","As soon as Tom was back we cut along the path, around the garden fence,"
"175","and by-and-by fetched up on the steep top of the hill the other side of"
"176","the house. Tom said he slipped Jim’s hat off of his head and hung it on"
"177","a limb right over him, and Jim stirred a little, but he didn’t wake."
"178","Afterwards Jim said the witches bewitched him and put him in a trance,"
"179","and rode him all over the State, and then set him under the trees"
"180","again, and hung his hat on a limb to show who done it. And next time"
"181","Jim told it he said they rode him down to New Orleans; and, after that,"
"182","every time he told it he spread it more and more, till by-and-by he"
"183","said they rode him all over the world, and tired him most to death, and"
"184","his back was all over saddle-boils. Jim was monstrous proud about it,"
"185","and he got so he wouldn’t hardly notice the other niggers. Niggers"
"186","would come miles to hear Jim tell about it, and he was more looked up"
"187","to than any nigger in that country. Strange niggers would stand with"
"188","their mouths open and look him all over, same as if he was a wonder."
"189","Niggers is always talking about witches in the dark by the kitchen"
"190","fire; but whenever one was talking and letting on to know all about"
"191","such things, Jim would happen in and say, “Hm! What you know ’bout"
"192","witches?” and that nigger was corked up and had to take a back seat."
"193","Jim always kept that five-center piece round his neck with a string,"
"194","and said it was a charm the devil give to him with his own hands, and"
"195","told him he could cure anybody with it and fetch witches whenever he"
"196","wanted to just by saying something to it; but he never told what it was"
"197","he said to it. Niggers would come from all around there and give Jim"
"198","anything they had, just for a sight of that five-center piece; but they"
"199","wouldn’t touch it, because the devil had had his hands on it. Jim was"
"200","most ruined for a servant, because he got stuck up on account of having"
"201","seen the devil and been rode by witches."
"202",""
"203","Well, when Tom and me got to the edge of the hilltop we looked away"
"204","down into the village and could see three or four lights twinkling,"
"205","where there was sick folks, maybe; and the stars over us was sparkling"
"206","ever so fine; and down by the village was the river, a whole mile"
"207","broad, and awful still and grand. We went down the hill and found Jo"
"208","Harper and Ben Rogers, and two or three more of the boys, hid in the"
"209","old tanyard. So we unhitched a skiff and pulled down the river two mile"
"210","and a half, to the big scar on the hillside, and went ashore."
"211",""
"212","We went to a clump of bushes, and Tom made everybody swear to keep the"
"213","secret, and then showed them a hole in the hill, right in the thickest"
"214","part of the bushes. Then we lit the candles, and crawled in on our"
"215","hands and knees. We went about two hundred yards, and then the cave"
"216","opened up. Tom poked about amongst the passages, and pretty soon ducked"
"217","under a wall where you wouldn’t a noticed that there was a hole. We"
"218","went along a narrow place and got into a kind of room, all damp and"
"219","sweaty and cold, and there we stopped. Tom says:"
"220",""
"221","“Now, we’ll start this band of robbers and call it Tom Sawyer’s Gang."
"222","Everybody that wants to join has got to take an oath, and write his"
"223","name in blood.”"
"224",""
"225","Everybody was willing. So Tom got out a sheet of paper that he had"
"226","wrote the oath on, and read it. It swore every boy to stick to the"
"227","band, and never tell any of the secrets; and if anybody done anything"
"228","to any boy in the band, whichever boy was ordered to kill that person"
"229","and his family must do it, and he mustn’t eat and he mustn’t sleep till"
"230","he had killed them and hacked a cross in their breasts, which was the"
"231","sign of the band. And nobody that didn’t belong to the band could use"
"232","that mark, and if he did he must be sued; and if he done it again he"
"233","must be killed. And if anybody that belonged to the band told the"
"234","secrets, he must have his throat cut, and then have his carcass burnt"
"235","up and the ashes scattered all around, and his name blotted off of the"
"236","list with blood and never mentioned again by the gang, but have a curse"
"237","put on it and be forgot forever."
"238",""
"239","Everybody said it was a real beautiful oath, and asked Tom if he got it"
"240","out of his own head. He said, some of it, but the rest was out of"
"241","pirate-books and robber-books, and every gang that was high-toned had"
"242","it."
"243",""
"244","Some thought it would be good to kill the _families_ of boys that told"
"245","the secrets. Tom said it was a good idea, so he took a pencil and wrote"
"246","it in. Then Ben Rogers says:"
"247",""
"248","“Here’s Huck Finn, he hain’t got no family; what you going to do ’bout"
"249","him?”"
"250",""
"251","“Well, hain’t he got a father?” says Tom Sawyer."
"252",""
"253","“Yes, he’s got a father, but you can’t never find him these days. He"
"254","used to lay drunk with the hogs in the tanyard, but he hain’t been seen"
"255","in these parts for a year or more.”"
"256",""
"257","They talked it over, and they was going to rule me out, because they"
"258","said every boy must have a family or somebody to kill, or else it"
"259","wouldn’t be fair and square for the others. Well, nobody could think of"
"260","anything to do—everybody was stumped, and set still. I was most ready"
"261","to cry; but all at once I thought of a way, and so I offered them Miss"
"262","Watson—they could kill her. Everybody said:"
"263",""
"264","“Oh, she’ll do. That’s all right. Huck can come in.”"
"265",""
"266","Then they all stuck a pin in their fingers to get blood to sign with,"

"273","“But who are we going to rob?—houses, or cattle, or—”"
"274",""
"275","“Stuff! stealing cattle and such things ain’t robbery; it’s burglary,”"
"276","says Tom Sawyer. “We ain’t burglars. That ain’t no sort of style. We"

"278","on, and kill the people and take their watches and money.”"
"279",""
"280","“Must we always kill the people?”"
"281",""
"282","“Oh, certainly. It’s best. Some authorities think different, but mostly"

"285",""
"286","“Ransomed? What’s that?”"

"366","off the grease and clay, and looked so sorry that I thought I would"
"367","behave a while if I could. Then Miss Watson she took me in the closet"
"368","and prayed, but nothing come of it. She told me to pray every day, and"
"369","whatever I asked for I would get it. But it warn’t so. I tried it. Once"
"370","I got a fish-line, but no hooks. It warn’t any good to me without"
"371","hooks. I tried for the hooks three or four times, but somehow I"

"380","No, says I to myself, there ain’t nothing in it. I went and told the"
"381","widow about it, and she said the thing a body could get by praying for"

"383","what she meant—I must help other people, and do everything I could for"
"384","other people, and look out for them all the time, and never think about"
"385","myself. This was including Miss Watson, as I took it. I went out in the"

"387","advantage about it—except for the other people; so at last I reckoned I"
"388","wouldn’t worry about it any more, but just let it go. Sometimes the"
"389","widow would take me one side and talk about Providence in a way to make"

"790","When he got out the new judge said he was a-going to make a man of him."
"791","So he took him to his own house, and dressed him up clean and nice, and"

"793","just old pie to him, so to speak. And after supper he talked to him"
"794","about temperance and such things till the old man cried, and said he’d"
"795","been a fool, and fooled away his life; but now he was a-going to turn"
"796","over a new leaf and be a man nobody wouldn’t be ashamed of, and he"
"797","hoped the judge would help him and not look down on him. The judge said"
"798","he could hug him for them words; so _he_ cried, and his wife she cried"
"799","again; pap said he’d been a man that had always been misunderstood"
"800","before, and the judge said he believed it. The old man said that what a"
"801","man wanted that was down was sympathy, and the judge said it was so; so"
"802","they cried again. And when it was bedtime the old man rose up and held"
"803","out his hand, and says:"

"805","“Look at it, gentlemen and ladies all; take a-hold of it; shake it."
"806","There’s a hand that was the hand of a hog; but it ain’t so no more;"

"814","something like that. Then they tucked the old man into a beautiful"
"815","room, which was the spare room, and in the night some time he got"
"816","powerful thirsty and clumb out on to the porch-roof and slid down a"
"817","stanchion and traded his new coat for a jug of forty-rod, and clumb"
"818","back again and had a good old time; and towards daylight he crawled out"
"819","again, drunk as a fiddler, and rolled off the porch and broke his left"
"820","arm in two places, and was most froze to death when somebody found him"
"821","after sun-up. And when they come to look at that spare room they had to"
"822","take soundings before they could navigate it."

"833","Well, pretty soon the old man was up and around again, and then he went"
"834","for Judge Thatcher in the courts to make him give up that money, and he"
"835","went for me, too, for not stopping school. He catched me a couple of"
"836","times and thrashed me, but I went to school just the same, and dodged"
"837","him or outrun him most of the time. I didn’t want to go to school much"
"838","before, but I reckoned I’d go now to spite pap. That law trial was a"
"839","slow business—appeared like they warn’t ever going to get started on"
"840","it; so every now and then I’d borrow two or three dollars off of the"
"841","judge for him, to keep from getting a cowhiding. Every time he got"

"845",""
"846","He got to hanging around the widow’s too much and so she told him at"
"847","last that if he didn’t quit using around there she would make trouble"
"848","for him. Well, _wasn’t_ he mad? He said he would show who was Huck"
"849","Finn’s boss. So he watched out for me one day in the spring, and"
"850","catched me, and took me up the river about three mile in a skiff, and"
"851","crossed over to the Illinois shore where it was woody and there warn’t"
"852","no houses but an old log hut in a place where the timber was so thick"
"853","you couldn’t find it if you didn’t know where it was."
"854",""
"855","He kept me with him all the time, and I never got a chance to run off."
"856","We lived in that old cabin, and he always locked the door and put the"

"858","and we fished and hunted, and that was what we lived on. Every little"
"859","while he locked me in and went down to the store, three miles, to the"
"860","ferry, and traded fish and game for whisky, and fetched it home and got"
"861","drunk and had a good time, and licked me. The widow she found out where"
"862","I was by-and-by, and she sent a man over to try to get hold of me; but"
"863","pap drove him off with the gun, and it warn’t long after that till I"

"865",""
"866","It was kind of lazy and jolly, laying off comfortable all day, smoking"
"867","and fishing, and no books nor study. Two months or more run along, and"
"868","my clothes got to be all rags and dirt, and I didn’t see how I’d ever"
"869","got to like it so well at the widow’s, where you had to wash, and eat"
"870","on a plate, and comb up, and go to bed and get up regular, and be"
"871","forever bothering over a book, and have old Miss Watson pecking at you"

"873","because the widow didn’t like it; but now I took to it again because"
"874","pap hadn’t no objections. It was pretty good times up in the woods"
"875","there, take it all around."
"876",""
"877","But by-and-by pap got too handy with his hick’ry, and I couldn’t stand"
"878","it. I was all over welts. He got to going away so much, too, and"
"879","locking me in. Once he locked me in and was gone three days. It was"
"880","dreadful lonesome. I judged he had got drownded, and I wasn’t ever"
"881","going to get out any more. I was scared. I made up my mind I would fix"
"882","up some way to leave there. I had tried to get out of that cabin many a"
"883","time, but I couldn’t find no way. There warn’t a window to it big"
"884","enough for a dog to get through. I couldn’t get up the chimbly; it was"
"885","too narrow. The door was thick, solid oak slabs. Pap was pretty careful"
"886","not to leave a knife or anything in the cabin when he was away; I"
"887","reckon I had hunted the place over as much as a hundred times; well, I"
"888","was most all the time at it, because it was about the only way to put"
"889","in the time. But this time I found something at last; I found an old"
"890","rusty wood-saw without any handle; it was laid in between a rafter and"
"891","the clapboards of the roof. I greased it up and went to work. There was"
"892","an old horse-blanket nailed against the logs at the far end of the"
"893","cabin behind the table, to keep the wind from blowing through the"
"894","chinks and putting the candle out. I got under the table and raised the"
"895","blanket, and went to work to saw a section of the big bottom log"
"896","out—big enough to let me through. Well, it was a good long job, but I"
"897","was getting towards the end of it when I heard pap’s gun in the woods."

"901","Pap warn’t in a good humor—so he was his natural self. He said he was"
"902","down town, and everything was going wrong. His lawyer said he reckoned"
"903","he would win his lawsuit and get the money if they ever got started on"
"904","the trial; but then there was ways to put it off a long time, and Judge"
"905","Thatcher knowed how to do it. And he said people allowed there’d be"
"906","another trial to get me away from him and give me to the widow for my"
"907","guardian, and they guessed it would win this time. This shook me up"
"908","considerable, because I didn’t want to go back to the widow’s any more"
"909","and be so cramped up and sivilized, as they called it. Then the old man"
"910","got to cussing, and cussed everything and everybody he could think of,"
"911","and then cussed them all over again to make sure he hadn’t skipped any,"
"912","and after that he polished off with a kind of a general cuss all round,"
"913","including a considerable parcel of people which he didn’t know the"
"914","names of, and so called them what’s-his-name when he got to them, and"
"915","went right along with his cussing."

"920","they dropped and they couldn’t find me. That made me pretty uneasy"

"922","he got that chance."

"924","The old man made me go to the skiff and fetch the things he had got."
"925","There was a fifty-pound sack of corn meal, and a side of bacon,"
"926","ammunition, and a four-gallon jug of whisky, and an old book and two"

"928","back and set down on the bow of the skiff to rest. I thought it all"
"929","over, and I reckoned I would walk off with the gun and some lines, and"
"930","take to the woods when I run away. I guessed I wouldn’t stay in one"
"931","place, but just tramp right across the country, mostly night times, and"
"932","hunt and fish to keep alive, and so get so far away that the old man"
"933","nor the widow couldn’t ever find me any more. I judged I would saw out"

"941","and laid in the gutter all night, and he was a sight to look at. A body"

"954","up’ards, and jams him into an old trap of a cabin like this, and lets"
"955","him go round in clothes that ain’t fitten for a hog. They call that"
"956","govment! A man can’t get his rights in a govment like this. Sometimes"
"957","I’ve a mighty notion to just leave the country for good and all. Yes,"
"958","and I _told_ ’em so; I told old Thatcher so to his face. Lots of ’em"
"959","heard me, and can tell what I said. Says I, for two cents I’d leave the"
"960","blamed country and never come a-near it agin. Them’s the very words. I"

"963","a hat at all, but more like my head was shoved up through a jint o’"

"1147","About twelve o’clock we turned out and went along up the bank. The"

"1150","We went out with the skiff and towed it ashore. Then we had dinner."
"1151","Anybody but pap would a waited and seen the day through, so as to catch"
"1152","more stuff; but that warn’t pap’s style. Nine logs was enough for one"
"1153","time; he must shove right over to town and sell. So he locked me in and"
"1154","took the skiff, and started off towing the raft about half-past three."
"1155","I judged he wouldn’t come back that night. I waited till I reckoned he"
"1156","had got a good start; then I out with my saw, and went to work on that"
"1157","log again. Before he was t’other side of the river I was out of the"
"1158","hole; him and his raft was just a speck on the water away off yonder."

"1163","and sugar there was, and all the ammunition; I took the wadding; I took"
"1164","the bucket and gourd; I took a dipper and a tin cup, and my old saw and"
"1165","two blankets, and the skillet and the coffee-pot. I took fish-lines and"
"1166","matches and other things—everything that was worth a cent. I cleaned"
"1167","out the place. I wanted an axe, but there wasn’t any, only the one out"

"1171","I had wore the ground a good deal crawling out of the hole and dragging"

"1174","the sawdust. Then I fixed the piece of log back into its place, and put"
"1175","two rocks under it and one against it to hold it there, for it was bent"
"1176","up at that place and didn’t quite touch ground. If you stood four or"
"1177","five foot away and didn’t know it was sawed, you wouldn’t never notice"

"1184","and was hunting around for some birds when I see a wild pig; hogs soon"
"1185","went wild in them bottoms after they had got away from the prairie"
"1186","farms. I shot this fellow and took him into camp."

"1188","I took the axe and smashed in the door. I beat it and hacked it"

"1191","on the ground to bleed; I say ground because it _was_ ground—hard"
"1192","packed, and no boards. Well, next I took an old sack and put a lot of"
"1193","big rocks in it—all I could drag—and I started it from the pig, and"
"1194","dragged it to the door and through the woods down to the river and"
"1195","dumped it in, and down it sunk, out of sight. You could easy see that"
"1196","something had been dragged over the ground. I did wish Tom Sawyer was"
"1197","there; I knowed he would take an interest in this kind of business, and"
"1198","throw in the fancy touches. Nobody could spread himself like Tom Sawyer"
"1199","in such a thing as that."

"1201","Well, last I pulled out some of my hair, and blooded the axe good, and"

"1203","up the pig and held him to my breast with my jacket (so he couldn’t"

"1205","the river. Now I thought of something else. So I went and got the bag"
"1206","of meal and my old saw out of the canoe, and fetched them to the house."
"1207","I took the bag to where it used to stand, and ripped a hole in the"
"1208","bottom of it with the saw, for there warn’t no knives and forks on the"
"1209","place—pap done everything with his clasp-knife about the cooking. Then"
"1210","I carried the sack about a hundred yards across the grass and through"
"1211","the willows east of the house, to a shallow lake that was five mile"
"1212","wide and full of rushes—and ducks too, you might say, in the season."
"1213","There was a slough or a creek leading out of it on the other side that"
"1214","went miles away, I don’t know where, but it didn’t go to the river. The"
"1215","meal sifted out and made a little track all the way to the lake. I"
"1216","dropped pap’s whetstone there too, so as to look like it had been done"
"1217","by accident. Then I tied up the rip in the meal sack with a string, so"
"1218","it wouldn’t leak no more, and took it and my saw to the canoe again."

"1224","they’ll follow the track of that sackful of rocks to the shore and then"
"1225","drag the river for me. And they’ll follow that meal track to the lake"
"1226","and go browsing down the creek that leads out of it to find the robbers"
"1227","that killed me and took the things. They won’t ever hunt the river for"

"1275","nothing to some things he had said in his time. I heard one man say it"

"1315","could see the sun out at one or two holes, but mostly it was big trees"
"1316","all about, and gloomy in there amongst them. There was freckled places"
"1317","on the ground where the light sifted down through the leaves, and the"

"1326","looked out at a hole in the leaves, and I see a bunch of smoke laying"
"1327","on the water a long ways up—about abreast the ferry. And there was the"
"1328","ferry-boat full of people floating along down. I knowed what was the"
"1329","matter now. “Boom!” I see the white smoke squirt out of the ferry-boat’s"

"1333","I was pretty hungry, but it warn’t going to do for me to start a fire,"

"1336","and it always looks pretty on a summer morning—so I was having a good"
"1337","enough time seeing them hunt for my remainders if I only had a bite to"
"1338","eat. Well, then I happened to think how they always put quicksilver in"
"1339","loaves of bread and float them off, because they always go right to the"
"1340","drownded carcass and stop there. So, says I, I’ll keep a lookout, and"
"1341","if any of them’s floating around after me I’ll give them a show. I"
"1342","changed to the Illinois edge of the island to see what luck I could"
"1343","have, and I warn’t disappointed. A big double loaf come along, and I"
"1344","most got it with a long stick, but my foot slipped and she floated out"
"1345","further. Of course I was where the current set in the closest to the"
"1346","shore—I knowed enough for that. But by-and-by along comes another one,"
"1347","and this time I won. I took out the plug and shook out the little dab"

"1354","or somebody prayed that this bread would find me, and here it has gone"
"1355","and done it. So there ain’t no doubt but there is something in that"
"1356","thing—that is, there’s something in it when a body like the widow or"

"1363","come in close, where the bread did. When she’d got pretty well along"
"1364","down towards me, I put out my pipe and went to where I fished out the"

"1477","little ripply, cool breeze begun to blow, and that was as good as"

"1770","This place was a tolerable long, steep hill or ridge about forty foot"

"1773","by-and-by found a good big cavern in the rock, most up to the top on"
"1774","the side towards Illinois. The cavern was as big as two or three rooms"

"1788","of the lines and set them again, and begun to get ready for dinner."

"1893","dog-collar, and a horseshoe, and some vials of medicine that didn’t"

"1922","We rummaged the clothes we’d got, and found eight dollars in silver"

"1955","told me to chop off the snake’s head and throw it away, and then skin"
"1956","the body and roast a piece of it. I done it, and he eat it and said it"
"1957","would help cure him. He made me take off the rattles and tie them"
"1958","around his wrist, too. He said that that would help. Then I slid out"

"1963","Jim sucked and sucked at the jug, and now and then he got out of his"

"1973","come of it. Jim said he reckoned I would believe him next time. And he"
"1974","said that handling a snake-skin was such awful bad luck that maybe we"
"1975","hadn’t got to the end of it yet. He said he druther see the new moon"
"1976","over his left shoulder as much as a thousand times than take up a"

"1987","Well, the days went along, and the river went down between its banks"
"1988","again; and about the first thing we done was to bait one of the big"
"1989","hooks with a skinned rabbit and set it and catch a catfish that was as"
"1990","big as a man, being six foot two inches long, and weighed over two"
"1991","hundred pounds. We couldn’t handle him, of course; he would a flung us"
"1992","into Illinois. We just set there and watched him rip and tear around"
"1993","till he drownded. We found a brass button in his stomach and a round"
"1994","ball, and lots of rubbage. We split the ball open with the hatchet, and"
"1995","there was a spool in it. Jim said he’d had it there a long time, to"
"1996","coat it over so and make a ball of it. It was as big a fish as was ever"
"1997","catched in the Mississippi, I reckon. Jim said he hadn’t ever seen a"
"1998","bigger one. He would a been worth a good deal over at the village. They"

"2006","go in the dark and look sharp. Then he studied it over and said,"
"2007","couldn’t I put on some of them old things and dress up like a girl?"
"2008","That was a good notion, too. So we shortened up one of the calico"

"2013","nobody would know me, even in the daytime, hardly. I practiced around"

"2370","When the first streak of day began to show we tied up to a tow-head in a"

"2374","cottonwoods on it as thick as harrow-teeth."
"2375",""
"2376","We had mountains on the Missouri shore and heavy timber on the Illinois"
"2377","side, and the channel was down the Missouri shore at that place, so we"
"2378","warn’t afraid of anybody running across us. We laid there all day, and"
"2379","watched the rafts and steamboats spin down the Missouri shore, and"
"2380","up-bound steamboats fight the big river in the middle. I told Jim all"

"2386","believed they must a gone up-town to get a dog and so they lost all"
"2387","that time, or else we wouldn’t be here on a tow-head sixteen or"
"2388","seventeen mile below the village—no, indeedy, we would be in that same"

"2395","snug wigwam to get under in blazing weather and rainy, and to keep the"
"2396","things dry. Jim made a floor for the wigwam, and raised it a foot or"
"2397","more above the level of the raft, so now the blankets and all the traps"
"2398","was out of reach of steamboat waves. Right in the middle of the wigwam"
"2399","we made a layer of dirt about five or six inches deep with a frame"

"2401","sloppy weather or chilly; the wigwam would keep it from being seen. We"
"2402","made an extra steering-oar, too, because one of the others might get"
"2403","broke on a snag or something. We fixed up a short forked stick to hang"
"2404","the old lantern on, because we must always light the lantern whenever"
"2405","we see a steamboat coming down-stream, to keep from getting run over;"
"2406","but we wouldn’t have to light it for up-stream boats unless we see we"
"2407","was in what they call a “crossing”; for the river was pretty high yet,"
"2408","very low banks being still a little under water; so up-bound boats"
"2409","didn’t always run the channel, but hunted easy water."
"2410",""
"2411","This second night we run between seven and eight hours, with a current"
"2412","that was making over four mile an hour. We catched fish and talked, and"
"2413","we took a swim now and then to keep off sleepiness. It was kind of"

"2423","up. In St. Petersburg they used to say there was twenty or thirty"
"2424","thousand people in St. Louis, but I never believed it till I see that"

"2428","Every night now I used to slip ashore towards ten o’clock at some"

"2430","other stuff to eat; and sometimes I lifted a chicken that warn’t"
"2431","roosting comfortable, and took him along. Pap always said, take a"
"2432","chicken when you get a chance, because if you don’t want him yourself"
"2433","you can easy find somebody that does, and a good deed ain’t ever"

"2437","Mornings before daylight I slipped into cornfields and borrowed a"

"2440","was meaning to pay them back some time; but the widow said it warn’t"
"2441","anything but a soft name for stealing, and no decent body would do it."
"2442","Jim said he reckoned the widow was partly right and pap was partly"
"2443","right; so the best way would be for us to pick out two or three things"
"2444","from the list and say we wouldn’t borrow them any more—then he reckoned"
"2445","it wouldn’t be no harm to borrow the others. So we talked it over all"
"2446","one night, drifting along down the river, trying to make up our minds"
"2447","whether to drop the watermelons, or the cantelopes, or the mushmelons,"
"2448","or what. But towards daylight we got it all settled satisfactory, and"
"2449","concluded to drop crabapples and p’simmons. We warn’t feeling just"
"2450","right before that, but it was all comfortable now. I was glad the way"
"2451","it come out, too, because crabapples ain’t ever good, and the p’simmons"
"2452","wouldn’t be ripe for two or three months yet."

"2454","We shot a water-fowl, now and, then that got up too early in the morning"

"3893","sometimes they wash them over with red water-paint that they call"
"3894","Spanish-brown, same as they do in town. They had big brass dog-irons"
"3895","that could hold up a saw-log. There was a clock on the middle of the"
"3896","mantelpiece, with a picture of a town painted on the bottom half of the"
"3897","glass front, and a round place in the middle of it for the sun, and you"
"3898","could see the pendulum swinging behind it. It was beautiful to hear"

"3952","mashing a locket with a chain to it against her mouth, and underneath"
"3953","the picture it said “And Art Thou Gone Yes Thou Art Gone Alas.” These"
"3954","was all nice pictures, I reckon, but I didn’t somehow seem to take to"

"3958","what they had lost. But I reckoned that with her disposition she was"

"3960","said was her greatest picture when she took sick, and every day and"
"3961","every night it was her prayer to be allowed to live till she got it"
"3962","done, but she never got the chance. It was a picture of a young woman"
"3963","in a long white gown, standing on the rail of a bridge all ready to"

"3965","with the tears running down her face, and she had two arms folded"

"3967","reaching up towards the moon—and the idea was to see which pair would"
"3968","look best, and then scratch out all the other arms; but, as I was"
"3969","saying, she died before she got her mind made up, and now they kept"
"3970","this picture over the head of the bed in her room, and every time her"

"4072","high nose, and heavy eyebrows, and the blackest kind of eyes, sunk so"
"4073","deep back that they seemed like they was looking out of caverns at you,"

"4076","every day of his life he put on a clean shirt and a full suit from head"
"4077","to foot made out of linen so white it hurt your eyes to look at it; and"
"4078","on Sundays he wore a blue tail-coat with brass buttons on it. He"
"4079","carried a mahogany cane with a silver head to it. There warn’t no"
"4080","frivolishness about him, not a bit, and he warn’t ever loud. He was as"
"4081","kind as he could be—you could feel that, you know, and so you had"
"4082","confidence. Sometimes he smiled, and it was good to see; but when he"
"4083","straightened himself up like a liberty-pole, and the lightning begun to"

"4583","there was a thick fog, and the rafts and things that went by was"

"4955","because he reckoned they warn’t high enough yet to do any harm; but he"
"4956","was mistaken about that, for pretty soon all of a sudden along comes a"

"5145","took in three subscriptions for half a dollar apiece on condition of"
"5146","them paying him in advance; they were going to pay in cordwood and"
"5147","onions as usual, but he said he had just bought the concern and knocked"
"5148","down the price as low as he could afford it, and was going to run it"
"5149","for cash. He set up a little piece of poetry, which he made, himself,"
"5150","out of his own head—three verses—kind of sweet and saddish—the name of"

"5688","got up and stood, and went a-weaving around the ring so gentle and wavy"
"5689","and graceful, the men looking ever so tall and airy and straight, with"
"5690","their heads bobbing and skimming along, away up there under the"
"5691","tent-roof, and every lady’s rose-leafy dress flapping soft and silky"
"5692","around her hips, and she looking like the most loveliest parasol."
"5693",""
"5694","And then faster and faster they went, all of them dancing, first one"
"5695","foot out in the air and then the other, the horses leaning more and"
"5696","more, and the ringmaster going round and round the center-pole,"
"5697","cracking his whip and shouting “Hi!—hi!” and the clown cracking jokes"
"5698","behind him; and by-and-by all hands dropped the reins, and every lady"
"5699","put her knuckles on her hips and every gentleman folded his arms, and"
"5700","then how the horses did lean over and hump themselves! And so one after"
"5701","the other they all skipped off into the ring, and made the sweetest bow"
"5702","I ever see, and then scampered out, and everybody clapped their hands"
"5703","and went just about wild."
"5704",""
"5705","Well, all through the circus they done the most astonishing things; and"
"5706","all the time that clown carried on so it most killed the people. The"
"5707","ringmaster couldn’t ever say a word to him but he was back at him quick"
"5708","as a wink with the funniest things a body ever said; and how he ever"
"5709","_could_ think of so many of them, and so sudden and so pat, was what I"
"5710","couldn’t noway understand. Why, I couldn’t a thought of them in a year."
"5711","And by-and-by a drunk man tried to get into the ring—said he wanted to"
"5712","ride; said he could ride as well as anybody that ever was. They argued"
"5713","and tried to keep him out, but he wouldn’t listen, and the whole show"
"5714","come to a standstill. Then the people begun to holler at him and make"
"5715","fun of him, and that made him mad, and he begun to rip and tear; so"
"5716","that stirred up the people, and a lot of men begun to pile down off of"
"5717","the benches and swarm towards the ring, saying, “Knock him down! throw"
"5718","him out!” and one or two women begun to scream. So, then, the"
"5719","ringmaster he made a little speech, and said he hoped there wouldn’t be"
"5720","no disturbance, and if the man would promise he wouldn’t make no more"
"5721","trouble he would let him ride if he thought he could stay on the horse."
"5722","So everybody laughed and said all right, and the man got on. The minute"
"5723","he was on, the horse begun to rip and tear and jump and cavort around,"
"5724","with two circus men hanging on to his bridle trying to hold him, and"
"5725","the drunk man hanging on to his neck, and his heels flying in the air"
"5726","every jump, and the whole crowd of people standing up shouting and"
"5727","laughing till tears rolled down. And at last, sure enough, all the"
"5728","circus men could do, the horse broke loose, and away he went like the"
"5729","very nation, round and round the ring, with that sot laying down on him"
"5730","and hanging to his neck, with first one leg hanging most to the ground"
"5731","on one side, and then t’other one on t’other side, and the people just"
"5732","crazy. It warn’t funny to me, though; I was all of a tremble to see his"
"5733","danger. But pretty soon he struggled up astraddle and grabbed the"
"5734","bridle, a-reeling this way and that; and the next minute he sprung up"
"5735","and dropped the bridle and stood! and the horse a-going like a house"
"5736","afire too. He just stood up there, a-sailing around as easy and"
"5737","comfortable as if he warn’t ever drunk in his life—and then he begun to"
"5738","pull off his clothes and sling them. He shed them so thick they kind of"
"5739","clogged up the air, and altogether he shed seventeen suits. And, then,"
"5740","there he was, slim and handsome, and dressed the gaudiest and prettiest"
"5741","you ever saw, and he lit into that horse with his whip and made him"
"5742","fairly hum—and finally skipped off, and made his bow and danced off to"
"5743","the dressing-room, and everybody just a-howling with pleasure and"
"5744","astonishment."
"5745",""
"5746","Then the ringmaster he see how he had been fooled, and he _was_ the"
"5747","sickest ringmaster you ever see, I reckon. Why, it was one of his own"
"5748","men! He had got up that joke all out of his own head, and never let on"
"5749","to nobody. Well, I felt sheepish enough to be took in so, but I"
"5750","wouldn’t a been in that ringmaster’s place, not for a thousand dollars."
"5751","I don’t know; there may be bullier circuses than what that one was, but"
"5752","I never struck them yet. Anyways, it was plenty good enough for _me_;"

"5756","Well, that night we had _our_ show; but there warn’t only about twelve"

"5797","to the stage and stood up before the curtain and made a little speech,"

"5799","that ever was; and so he went on a-bragging about the tragedy, and"
"5800","about Edmund Kean the Elder, which was to play the main principal part"

"6060","We had all bought store clothes where we stopped last; and now the king"

"6066","that grand and good and pious that you’d say he had walked right out of"

"7617","down sorrowful on them new-comers like it give him the stomach-ache in"
"7618","his very heart to think there could be such frauds and rascals in the"
"7619","world. Oh, he done it admirable. Lots of the principal people gethered"
"7620","around the king, to let him see they was on his side. That old"
"7621","gentleman that had just come looked all puzzled to death. Pretty soon"
"7622","he begun to speak, and I see straight off he pronounced _like_ an"
"7623","Englishman—not the king’s way, though the king’s _was_ pretty good for"
"7624","an imitation. I can’t give the old gent’s words, nor I can’t imitate"

"7627","“This is a surprise to me which I wasn’t looking for; and I’ll"
"7628","acknowledge, candid and frank, I ain’t very well fixed to meet it and"
"7629","answer it; for my brother and me has had misfortunes; he’s broke his"
"7630","arm, and our baggage got put off at a town above here last night in the"
"7631","night by a mistake. I am Peter Wilks’ brother Harvey, and this is his"
"7632","brother William, which can’t hear nor speak—and can’t even make signs"
"7633","to amount to much, now’t he’s only got one hand to work them with. We"
"7634","are who we say we are; and in a day or two, when I get the baggage, I"
"7635","can prove it. But up till then I won’t say nothing more, but go to the"
"7636","hotel and wait.”"
"7637",""

"7641","“Broke his arm—_very_ likely, _ain’t_ it?—and very convenient, too, for"
"7642","a fraud that’s got to make signs, and ain’t learnt how. Lost their"

"7652","gone up to Louisville; and another one was a big rough husky that come"

"8038","lit out. It didn’t seem no good for _me_ to stay—_I_ couldn’t do"
"8039","nothing, and I didn’t want to be hung if I could get away. So I never"

"8181","We dasn’t stop again at any town for days and days; kept right along"

"8183","long ways from home. We begun to come to trees with Spanish moss on"
"8184","them, hanging down from the limbs like long, gray beards. It was the"
"8185","first I ever see it growing, and it made the woods look solemn and"
"8186","dismal. So now the frauds reckoned they was out of danger, and they"
"8187","begun to work the villages again."
"8188",""
"8189","First they done a lecture on temperance; but they didn’t make enough"
"8190","for them both to get drunk on. Then in another village they started a"

"8192","kangaroo does; so the first prance they made the general public jumped"
"8193","in and pranced them out of town. Another time they tried to go at"
"8194","yellocution; but they didn’t yellocute long till the audience got up"
"8195","and give them a solid good cussing, and made them skip out. They"
"8196","tackled missionarying, and mesmerizing, and doctoring, and telling"
"8197","fortunes, and a little of everything; but they couldn’t seem to have no"
"8198","luck. So at last they got just about dead broke, and laid around the"
"8199","raft as she floated along, thinking and thinking, and never saying"
"8200","nothing, by the half a day at a time, and dreadful blue and desperate."
"8201",""
"8202","And at last they took a change and begun to lay their heads together in"
"8203","the wigwam and talk low and confidential two or three hours at a time."
"8204","Jim and me got uneasy. We didn’t like the look of it. We judged they"
"8205","was studying up some kind of worse deviltry than ever. We turned it"
"8206","over and over, and at last we made up our minds they was going to break"
"8207","into somebody’s house or store, or was going into the counterfeit-money"
"8208","business, or something. So then we was pretty scared, and made up an"
"8209","agreement that we wouldn’t have nothing in the world to do with such"
"8210","actions, and if we ever got the least show we would give them the cold"
"8211","shake and clear out and leave them behind. Well, early one morning we"
"8212","hid the raft in a good, safe place about two mile below a little bit of"
"8213","a shabby village named Pikesville, and the king he went ashore and told"
"8214","us all to stay hid whilst he went up to town and smelt around to see if"
"8215","anybody had got any wind of the Royal Nonesuch there yet. (“House to"
"8216","rob, you _mean_,” says I to myself; “and when you get through robbing"
"8217","it you’ll come back here and wonder what has become of me and Jim and"
"8218","the raft—and you’ll have to take it out in wondering.”) And he said if"
"8219","he warn’t back by midday the duke and me would know it was all right,"
"8220","and we was to come along."
"8221",""
"8222","So we stayed where we was. The duke he fretted and sweated around, and"
"8223","was in a mighty sour way. He scolded us for everything, and we couldn’t"
"8224","seem to do nothing right; he found fault with every little thing."
"8225","Something was a-brewing, sure. I was good and glad when midday come and"
"8226","no king; we could have a change, anyway—and maybe a chance for _the_"
"8227","change on top of it. So me and the duke went up to the village, and"
"8228","hunted around there for the king, and by-and-by we found him in the"
"8229","back room of a little low doggery, very tight, and a lot of loafers"
"8230","bullyragging him for sport, and he a-cussing and a-threatening with all"
"8231","his might, and so tight he couldn’t walk, and couldn’t do nothing to"
"8232","them. The duke he begun to abuse him for an old fool, and the king"
"8233","begun to sass back, and the minute they was fairly at it I lit out and"
"8234","shook the reefs out of my hind legs, and spun down the river road like"
"8235","a deer, for I see our chance; and I made up my mind that it would be a"
"8236","long day before they ever see me and Jim again. I got down there all"

"8305","anybody from that town again I’d be ready to get down and lick his"

"8311","when it hit me all of a sudden that here was the plain hand of"
"8312","Providence slapping me in the face and letting me know my wickedness"

"8320","something inside of me kept saying, “There was the Sunday-school, you"

"8325","It made me shiver. And I about made up my mind to pray, and see if I"

"8327","kneeled down. But the words wouldn’t come. Why wouldn’t they? It warn’t"
"8328","no use to try and hide it from Him. Nor from _me_, neither. I knowed"
"8329","very well why they wouldn’t come. It was because my heart warn’t right;"

"8331","was letting _on_ to give up sin, but away inside of me I was holding on"

"8357","a-floating along, talking and singing and laughing. But somehow I"
"8358","couldn’t seem to strike no places to harden me against him, but only"
"8359","the other kind. I’d see him standing my watch on top of his’n, ’stead"

"8363","always call me honey, and pet me and do everything he could think of"
"8364","for me, and how good he always was; and at last I struck the time I"
"8365","saved him by telling the men we had small-pox aboard, and he was so"
"8366","grateful, and said I was the best friend old Jim ever had in the world,"
"8367","and the _only_ one he’s got now; and then I happened to look around and"
"8368","see that paper."

"8370","It was a close place. I took it up, and held it in my hand. I was"

"8380","which was in my line, being brung up to it, and the other warn’t. And"
"8381","for a starter I would go to work and steal Jim out of slavery again;"
"8382","and if I could think up anything worse, I would do that, too; because"

"9778","That night we went down the lightning-rod a little after ten, and took"
"9779","one of the candles along, and listened under the window-hole, and heard"

"9781","whirled in with the pick and shovel, and in about two hours and a half"
"9782","the job was done. We crept in under Jim’s bed and into the cabin, and"
"9783","pawed around and found the candle and lit it, and stood over Jim"
"9784","awhile, and found him looking hearty and healthy, and then we woke him"
"9785","up gentle and gradual. He was so glad to see us he most cried; and"
"9786","called us honey, and all the pet names he could think of; and was for"

"9791","alarm; and not to be the least afraid, because we would see he got"
"9792","away, _sure_. So Jim he said it was all right, and we set there and"

"9794","and when Jim told him Uncle Silas come in every day or two to pray with"

"9819","spirits. He said it was the best fun he ever had in his life, and the"
"9820","most intellectural; and said if he only could see his way to it we"
"9821","would keep it up all the rest of our lives and leave Jim to our"
"9822","children to get out; for he believed Jim would come to like it better"
"9823","and better the more he got used to it. He said that in that way it"
"9824","could be strung out to as much as eighty year, and would be the best"
"9825","time on record. And he said it would make us all celebrated that had a"
