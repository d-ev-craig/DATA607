NA,"A life transition experience can be positive or negative, planned or unexpected. Some transitions happen without warning, and they may be quite dramatic, as in cases of accidents, death, divorce, job loss, or serious illness. Other life transitions come from positive experiences such as getting married, going away to college, starting a new job, moving to a new city. Even though events like these are usually planned and anticipated, they can be just as life-altering as the unexpected events. Whether positive or negative, life transitions cause us to leave behind the familiar and force us to adjust to new ways of living.",& Online

NA,Life is a journey of many ups and downs with many bumps in the road along the way. I specialize in helping people with those bumps. When I began working in this field I treated adults whom have problems with substance abuse. As I worked with this population I realized that many of my clients were dealing with a plethora of other mental health issues. I continued to refine my skills in therapy I then spent a few years working primarily with children (as young as toddlers through adolescence)also with their parents and families as well. This taught me that many problems people have as adults can begin when they are very young.,& Online

External pressures like work or parenting can cause distance in our connection with our partner, friends, and the world. At times, finding the way back to stability and security in our relationships can feel just out of reach, leaving us feeling helpless and stuck.

The work usually goes quickly and very directly... but sometimes we need to go slow. A typical successful series might be 10-12 meetings.

Keonna Robinson,"Marriage & Family Therapist, MA, LMFT","Los Angeles,   CA   90007"
NA,"Life, without a doubt, can be burdensome with its obligations and expectations often leaving us feeling stuck, unheard and alone. Between managing the demands of daily stressors it can feel like we're drowning and we forget to take care of ourselves. Yet, the gift of self expression gives us permission to return the love and energy we give outwardly to ourselves. Using strength-based techniques, I work collaboratively with individuals, couples and families seeking lasting relief from the strife's of “adulting”, anxiety, depression and complex trauma.",& Online
